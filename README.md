# Linux Guide and Hints

This wiki uses a forked/heavily modified version of [Sphinx RTD Theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme).

Originally, this was planned to be a separate repository, but was
decided against for two reasons:

- It would be annoying to maintain two separate repositories.
- Nested repositories (submodules) are even more annoying.

Therefore, this exists as a subsection of Louis Abel's
website. This is still licensed using the MIT License, which can be found in the root directory of his repository.

See the top-level README for development information.
